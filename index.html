      The Basics of the Web 
  </div>

  <h1> How the Web Works</h1>

  <div class="description">
    The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents. Types of files that can be found on the web
    <br>are plain text, HTML, Images, Videos and Music.The major pieces of the web are your computer & browser,
    <br> The Internet, HTTP, and servers.
    <br>
    <br>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents,
    <br> and then interpret and display them.
    <br>
    <br>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The
    <br> computer can then follow the instructions for example: the computer might do this by making text like
    <br> this: <b>the results are real</b>.
  </div>

  <h1>HTML</h1>
  <div class="description">
    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the main type of content and HTML documents are the heart
    <br> of the web. It is made up of text content, markup, and references to other documents.
    <br> Content is what you see; Markup is what the content looks like; and there are references to other documents.
  </div>

  <h1>Tags and Elements</h1>
  <div class="description">HTML markup is made up of tags like what is being used to <em>italicize </em>. There is an open tag and a closing tag;
    <br> For example: <b> contents</b> = bold. An HTML tag is always contain within angled brackets. Most tags have an
    <br> opening tag (..p..) and a closing tag (../p..).
    <br>
    <br> Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the ..br.. tag). An HTML element refers to
    <br> everything within a set of opening and closing tags. Span and div tags are normal elements used to contain
    <br>their content. The difference is that Span is inline and div is block. You can attach styles to them to help
    <br> with the display of your document
    <br>

    <br> An Attribute is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to
    <br>the Udacity URL, you would write ..a.. with the ../a.. closing tag
    <a> href="www.udacity.com" </a>
  </div>
  <h1>CSS</h1>

  <div class="description"> CSS controls the "style" of a page. When programmers talk about the <b>DOM </b> they are talking about the
    <br> tree-like structure of a page. The style is the basically the way that you want your web to look. Like
    <br>almost everything that exists there are applied rules to every element and repetition is one that should
    <br> be avoided in all programming; the most applied rule applies to your document.
    <br> Avoiding <b> repetition</b> can by acheived by using HTML classes and CSS style can help you avoid repetition.
    <br> Repetition will result in the need to copy the same code over and over again. If a change in the code is
    <br> needed every instance of the same code will have to be updated. This can lead to errors in the code.
    <br>The benefits of no repetition is a nice clean code and if changes are needed they only have to be done once.</div>

  <h1> Creating a Structure Document with HTML</h1>

  <div class="description"><b> Developer Tools</b> for HTML elements are either <b>inline </b>or <b> block</b>. Block elements form an invisible box
    <br>around the content inside of them.
    <br>

    <b> The tree-like structure of HTML</b> comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside
    <br> of them. The relationship is like a family tree. the structure shows up as a series of nested boxs inside a
    <br> browser, showing boxes inside of boxes. The relationshiop between indented HTML and Boxes
    <br>
    <br>When you read an HTML document as <em> text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down
    <br>the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it 's corresponding box.</div>
